# Banking_System

As part of my first task as a Web Development Domain intern at GRIP, I developed a web application hosted on XAMPP using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP. This site manages dummy data for 14 customers, enabling users to view customer entries, transfer money, and access a comprehensive list of transactions. The customer entries feature provides detailed information, while the transfer functionality allows seamless fund transfers between customers, with real-time balance updates. The system includes validation to prevent transfers exceeding the available balance, displaying a warning if necessary. Additionally, the transaction history feature offers transparency, showing details of each transaction, including date, time, sender, recipient, and amount. This project demonstrates my web development, database management, and user interface design skills, laying a solid foundation for future tasks during my GRIP internship.
